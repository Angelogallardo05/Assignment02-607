# Introduction
This assignment creates a data fram that shows a rating on a scale of 1-5 of recent movies. The data will be sourced from a Movie_ratings in MYSQL.
```{r}
install.packages("RMySQL")
library(RMySQL)
con <- dbConnect(MySQL(), 
                 user = "root", 
                 password = "CUNYsps1295", 
                 dbname = "Movie_ratings", 
                 host = "34.121.209.100")
result <- dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM Movie_ratings")
summary(result)

result[result == ""] <- 0
result                   
```
#Conclusion
I was able to load the SQL data into R and adjust the blank values.
